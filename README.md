### Ping pong

Let's play ping pong. One paddle is moved by a button up and down, while the second paddle is controlled by using the 'w' key to move up and the 's' key to move down.
  
The project is written in Python. OOP was used to create three seperated modules with classes: scoreboard, paddle and ball.

### Setup

Python 3.10.3 version was used. Are you uncertain about your version? Use command line `python --version`.

The project depends on the turtle - Turtle graphics - Python and `time` library.

### How to run?

You can run the script from PyCharm, which was used during creating the code, but it depends on your preferences.
However be aware that you may need to rewrite the connection between the modules which could be different than it is. 
 
### Important information

The code was written by me as the part of the online course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Projects created by Dr. Angela Yu.
The tutorial was used mainly to check whether the code is correct and for little help.
